What we have here is a list of the most frequently-used common nouns (i.e. not proper nouns) in English, the largest plain list of its kind freely available on this great internet (currently storing 6,775 nouns). It compiles a large number of common nouns including clothing, raw materials, professions, transportation, abstract concepts, matter, food, education, and many and sundry objects.

There are many sources on the internet for collecting tens of thousands of nouns (word corpuses, dictionary APIs, text mining Wikipedia), but my noun list is different because it contains only very frequently-used ones, and it has been checked line-by-line with actual human eyes to make sure that the words in it are ones that I’ve seen before. This makes the list more practical for use in software that will process normal written English. The list is an alphabetised text file with each word on a new line.

Guidelines for word selection
The nouns are singular (leg versus legs, baby versus babies) except where the noun is commonly used collectively (pants versus pant, barracks versus barrack).
There are some abstract collective nouns like earnings or statistics. I keep these if they are commonly used.
There are no proper nouns like countries and people’s names, nor are there racial, national, or religious groups (e.g. Albanian or Christian).
Some words are both nouns and verbs (swimming or climbing or gliding). I kept these words if their noun form is regularly used by people in everyday speech (“I went swimming yesterday”).
