# Anagram Ladder - A mobile word game built with Flutter

[Anagram Ladder](https://matthewmanela.com/anagram-ladder/) is a challenging word game on Android and iPhone for those who love to unscramble long words. The game tasks you to solve a word ladder by unscrambling progressively longer words.
The game offers a range of difficulties with the most difficult levels requiring unscrambling 10-letter words (very hard!).

This is the full source code to the iOS and Android game. This is a good example for getting started building basic word games in Flutter. Since this was written in 2021, some
of the dependencies and patterns are dated compared to the state of art Flutter.  

## Source
- The main game is stored in the lib folder
- The tools for pre-processing word files is stored in the tools folder
